Problem 1 - STANFORD Online - Design & Algorithms

The file contains all the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (including both) in some random order( no integer is repeated).

Your task is to find the number of inversions in the file given (every row has a single integer between 1 and 100,000). Assume your array is from 1 to 100,000 and ith row of the file gives you the ith entry of the array.
