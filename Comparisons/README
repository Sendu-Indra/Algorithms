Problem 2 - STANFORD Online - Design & Algorithms

The file contains all of the integers between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive) in unsorted order (with no integer repeated). The integer in the ith row of the file gives you the ith entry of an input array.

Your task is to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort. As you know, the number of comparisons depends on which elements are chosen as pivots, so we'll ask you to explore three different pivoting rules.
